Loopminds is a trip planner web application built from the ground up - currently in development (https://github.com/vincee48/bucketlist) and is at the point where it could begin integrating with hotels and flights whitelabel solutions (or API solutions).

Loopminds provides an intuitive and unopinionated approach to booking your trips, as opposed to current trip planning solutions available. We believe that day is not limited to the amount of hours, however is open to the amount of experiences the user would like to have.
